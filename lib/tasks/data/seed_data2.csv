Haughwout Building is a five-story, 79-foot (24 m) tall, commercial loft building in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, at the corner of Broome Street and Broadway. Built in 1857 to a design by John P. Gaynor, with cast-iron facades for two street-fronts provided by Daniel D. Badger's Architectural Iron Works,[2] it originally housed Eder V. Haughwout's fashionable emporium, which sold imported cut glass and silverware as well as its own handpainted china and fine chandeliers,[2][3] and which attracted many wealthy clients – including Mary Todd Lincoln, who had new official White House china made there.[4]Architecturally, the building is fairly typical of the period, with cast-iron facings in an arcaded system with two orders of columns that was derived from the Sansovino Library in Venice.[5] In one respect, though, the building was different from other cast-iron buildings of the time: because it fronted on two streets, it would need two cast-iron facades, the weight of which might bring down the structure. To avoid this, rather than hanging the facades off the brickwork, as was usually done, Gaynor and Badger convinced Haughwout to allow them to use the strength of the cast-iron itself to support the building. This use of a structural metal frame was a precursor to the steel-framed skyscrapers that would start to be built in the early 20th century; in fact, some consider it to the first skyscraper and ""the most important cast-iron structure ever built"".[4]In one other respect, the Haughwout Building was a trailblazing project: the building installed the world's first successful passenger elevator on March 23, 1857, a hydraulic lift designed for the building by Elisha Graves Otis. It cost $300, had a speed of .67 feet per second (0.20 m/s),[6] and was powered by a steam-engine installed in the basement.[4] Although the five-story structure was no taller than other buildings of the time, and did not actually require an elevator, Haughwout knew that people would come to see the new novelty, and stay to buy merchandise.[4]The building was in danger of being razed for Robert Moses' planned Lower Manhattan Expressway, which was proposed in 1941 and not finally defeated until 1969. The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1965, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Enormously influential in the civic construction of other American cities, its application of Beaux-Arts architecture served as the prototype for the Terminal Tower in Cleveland, and the Wrigley Building in Chicago, in addition to the Seven Sisters of Stalin-era Soviet architecture.Located at the intersection of Chambers Street and Centre Street, the Municipal Building, which stands 580 feet (177 m) tall, is one of the largest governmental buildings in the world. It houses thirteen municipal agencies of New York City, and until 2009, when the Manhattan Marriage Bureau moved to another city building at 80 Centre Street,[4][5] 18,000 people[6] were married in its second floor chapel each year. There are 25 floors of work space served by 33 elevators, with an additional 15 stories in the tower.The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1966,[3] and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972."

It is used for excursion trips and, since 1956, as the ferry terminal to Governors Island.[1]The Beaux-Arts building was built from 1906 to 1909 as the Municipal Ferry Piers,[2] and was used by ferries traveling to 39th Street in Brooklyn. Designed by the firm Walker and Morris,[2][3] it used a variety of architectural metals, including cast iron, rolled steel, and stamped zinc and copper, and the vaults under the porch roof utilize Guastavino tiles.[2]The building was originally constructed with a wide central stairway to large upper level waiting room. The upper level had a direct connection to the elevated train station that served it, the Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal and Lower Manhattan. The terminal had three slips, 5, 6, and 7, its lower level serving as a vehicular loading area for wagons and motor vehicles. A Staten Island Ferry Terminal was constructed at the same time and appeared as a two slip twin. That building was gutted by fire in 1991 replaced with an interim structure that was replaced in 2009.The Brooklyn ferry service shut down on March 15, 1938, and the 140,000 sq. ft. building was used by various city agencies. In subsequent years, its original multi-colored appearance was replaced by a paint color intended to emulate the copper patina of the Statue of Liberty.In 1956, the U.S. Army began use of the terminal to provide service to an Army post, Fort Jay on Governors Island. Replacing smaller steam-power ferries with two larger new diesel-electric boats, the Army required larger ferry slips and docks, moving their ferry operation from an open ferry slip located at the Barge Office, west of the Staten Island Ferry Terminal to the Battery Maritime Building. When the United States Coast Guard took over Governors Island from the Army in 1966, they continued to used the terminal to provide vehicle and passenger service to the island for its 3000 residents and 2000 daily commuters until its departure in 1996.Between 2001 and 2005, in a 36 million dollar renovation, the exterior of the building and its deteriorating wooden piers were restored and its exterior repainted in its original multiple color scheme by Jan Hird Pokorny Architects.[3]Today, during the summer season, public ferry service to Governors Island continues from the Battery Maritime Building, operated by the Trust for Governors Island, an agency for the City of New York, since 2003.",,,"[""Port of New York and New Jersey"", ""Ferry transportation in New York City"", ""Buildings and structures in Manhattan""]",,,"Coordinates: 40°42′04″N 74°00′42″W﻿ / ﻿40.70111°N 74.01167°W﻿ / 40.70111; -74.01167The Battery Maritime Building is a ferry terminal at 10 South Street at the corner of South and Whitehall Streets near South Ferry at the tip of Manhattan.

West Street Building,//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/90_West_Street_Building.jpg/250px-90_West_Street_Building.jpg,,"90 West Street (alternatively West Street Building) is a building in Lower Manhattan, New York City designed by architect Cass Gilbert and structural engineer Gunvald Aus for the West Street Improvement Corporation.[2] When completed in 1907, the building's Gothic styling and ornamentation served to emphasize its 23-story height, and foreshadowed Gilbert's later work on the Woolworth Building. Originally built as an office building, the main tenant was the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and the top floor was occupied by Garret's Restaurant, which advertised itself as the ""world's highest restaurant"".[3][4]Located on West Street, between Cedar and Albany Streets, just south of the World Trade Center site, the building had a view to the Hudson River before Battery Park City was built on fill across West Street.In 1998, the building's exterior was designated an architectural landmark by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission. In 2006, it received a National Preservation Honor Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation.[5] Restoration of the lobby revealed some of Gilbert's original terra cotta work that had been covered over during an earlier modernization project. During this restoration, the copper roof was replaced and replacement gargoyles were added.[6] The building was converted into apartments and reopened on March 7, 2005.[7]The building was severely damaged in the September 11, 2001 attacks when the south tower of the World Trade Center collapsed directly across the street. Scaffolding which had been erected on the facade for renovation work did nothing to stop the fiery debris from raining into the building and tearing a gash deep down its northern face.[4] Two office workers were killed when they were trapped in an elevator. The firestorm raged out of control for several days; the building, which had housed businesses including Hanover Capital, Frost & Sullivan, and IKON Office Solutions, was completely gutted. It is believed that 90 West's heavy building materials and extensive use of terra cotta inside and out helped serve as fireproofing and protected it from further damage and collapse, as opposed to the more modern skyscraper at 7 World Trade Center, which suffered similar damage and collapsed later that day.[3]On November 26, 2007, a mammoth sewer pipe burst open into the bottom floors of 90 West from the World Trade Center construction site, damaging dozens of luxury cars and causing a two week evacuation of the building's residents.[8][9]",,Private,"[""Skyscrapers in Manhattan"", ""Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Manhattan"", ""Cass Gilbert buildings"", ""Office buildings completed in 1907"", ""Skyscrapers between 50 and 99 meters"", ""Lower Manhattan""]",,"90 West St., New York, New York","90 West Street (alternatively West Street Building) is a building in Lower Manhattan, New York City designed by architect Cass Gilbert and structural engineer Gunvald Aus for the West Street Improvement Corporation.[2] When completed in 1907, the building's Gothic styling and ornamentation served to emphasize its 23-story height, and foreshadowed Gilbert's later work on the Woolworth Building.
